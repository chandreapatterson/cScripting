# C++ Scripting Project




## Description

The C++ Scripting Project is a project created to demonstrate the fundamentals of C++. It is an academic exercise that covers essential concepts, including arrays, control structures, functions, data types, pointers, memory management, variables, and object-oriented programming. This project explores core principles by requiring student registration sample data to be recorded and updated using C++ implementations.

- Git for cloning the repository

### Setup Instructions (for GCC or Clang compilers)
1. Clone the repository:

	```
 	git clone https://github.com/chandreapatterson/cScripting.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

	```
 	cd main

3. Compile the project

	```
 	g++ main.cpp -o main

4. Run the executable

	```
 	./main

### Setup Instructions (for Visual Studio)
1. Clone the repository:

	```
 	git clone https://github.com/chandreapatterson/cScripting.git
 
2. Locate and open the main.sln file using Visual Studio



## Usage

After installation, you can run the project (Visual Studio) or use the following command (GCC or Clang):

 	./main

The script will perform an insertion of a sample record while printing to the console.
